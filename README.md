<h4>My contributions</h4>

- The table content can be loaded/saved from LocalStorage.

- We can add new movie the the list.
- Adding an extra column on the right with a trash icon in front of each row, to delete it.
- Adding a new column to display an image for each movie.
- Adding a search form for searching a film/serie by name: reducing the table as we type!
- Improving the CSS to make it appear better.
- Adding the header and making the table sortable when clicking on the header of one column.
- Adding buttons for pagination: only display films/series 5 by 5, use Next page/Previous page for navigating. disabling the Previous page button on the first page, the Next Page button on the last page.
- etc..
